# Parcel Bootstrap SCSS Boilerplate

### The objective of this project is to implement a clone page using Parcel as bundler, Bootstrap as a CSS framework and SCSS as a preprocessor.


This project is a trial task exam from one of the companies I applied.
This is to clone a section of the www.pianote.com (play your favorite songs)


# What I learned:

* parcel bundler
* bootstrap, scss, fontawesome icons integration to parcel
* display:grid CSS layout styling
* svg and video HTML tags

# HOW TO INSTALL
1. Download the project to your local
2. cd to project root directory
3. run npm install
4. run rm -rf .cache dist
4. run npm run build (it should generate the dist folder)
5. open dist/index.html with browser

Optional if you want to run via development mode:
4. rm -rf .cache dist
5. run npm run dev (it should automatically open your default browser for you with the app project)
