# Parcel Bootstrap SCSS Boilerplate

### The objective of this project is to implement a clone page using Parcel as bundler, Bootstrap as a CSS framework and SCSS as a preprocessor.


This project is a trial task exam from one of the companies I applied.
This is to clone a section of the www.pianote.com (play your favorite songs) and ensure that it's mobile and tablet responsive.


# What I learned:

* parcel bundler
* bootstrap, scss, fontawesome icons integration to parcel
* display:grid CSS layout styling
* svg and video HTML tags

# HOW TO INSTALL
1. Download the project to your local
2. cd to project root directory
3. run npm install
4. run npm run build (it should generate the dist folder)
5. open dist/index.html with browser

Optional if you want to run via development mode:
5. run npm run dev (it should automatically open your default browser for you with the app project)
